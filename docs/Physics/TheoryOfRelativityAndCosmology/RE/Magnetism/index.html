  <h1>Magnetism as a Relativistic Phenomenon</h1>

  <p>
    Have you ever wondered why moving electric charges produce magnetic fields? Or why magnetic fields can influence electric currents? 
    The deep connection between electricity and magnetism becomes beautifully clear through the lens of Einstein’s theory of Special Relativity.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Foundations: Electric and Magnetic Fields</h2>
  <p>
    Electric fields are created by charges. Magnetic fields, as it turns out, are also produced by moving charges. But here's the twist —
    magnetism is actually a *relativistic effect* of electricity! That means magnetism wouldn't exist if we didn't live in a relativistic universe.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Relativistic Length Contraction and Current-Carrying Wires</h2>
  <p>
    Consider a long wire with positive ions fixed in place and electrons moving as a current. To a stationary observer, the wire is electrically neutral.
    But what happens when we observe this wire from a moving frame of reference — say, moving alongside the electrons?
  </p>

  <div class="equation">
    $$ L = L_0 \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} $$
  </div>

  <p>
    This is the famous length contraction equation. From the perspective of the moving observer, the positive ions in the wire appear more densely packed
    due to this contraction, while the electrons appear stationary. This imbalance leads to an electric field — hence, a magnetic effect observed in the stationary frame.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Real-World Example: Particle Accelerators</h2>
  <p>
    In particle accelerators, charged particles move at speeds close to the speed of light. The magnetic forces they experience are actually 
    manifestations of electric fields from the lab frame — shifted due to relativistic motion.
  </p>

  <div class="interactive">
    <h3>Interactive Example</h3>
    <p>Type a speed (as a fraction of the speed of light, c) to see length contraction:</p>
    <input type="number" id="speedInput" placeholder="e.g., 0.9" step="0.01" min="0" max="1">
    <button onclick="calculateContraction()">Calculate</button>
    <p id="result"></p>
  </div>

  <script>
    function calculateContraction() {
      const v = parseFloat(document.getElementById("speedInput").value);
      if (v < 0 || v >= 1) {
        document.getElementById("result").innerText = "Enter a speed between 0 and 1.";
        return;
      }
      const L0 = 1; // Let's say rest length is 1 meter
      const L = L0 * Math.sqrt(1 - v*v);
      document.getElementById("result").innerText = `Contracted length: ${L.toFixed(4)} meters`;
    }
  </script>

  <h2>4. Magnetic Force as a Relativistic Effect</h2>
  <p>
    When a test charge moves near a current-carrying wire, it experiences a magnetic force. But in the frame of the test charge,
    there’s a different charge density due to relativistic effects. What appears as a magnetic force in one frame is just an electric field in another!
  </p>

  <h2>5. Practical Applications</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Electromagnets:</strong> Used in MRI machines, speakers, and motors — rely on this relativistic relationship.</li>
    <li><strong>GPS Systems:</strong> Account for both general and special relativistic effects to maintain accurate timing.</li>
    <li><strong>Transformers:</strong> Efficient power transfer is explained by changing magnetic and electric fields — inherently relativistic.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Fun Fact</h2>
  <p>
    Did you know? Magnetism disappears entirely if you ignore special relativity. If the speed of light were infinite (i.e., no relativistic effects),
    magnetic fields wouldn’t exist at all!
  </p>

  <h2>7. Mathematical Summary</h2>
  <p>The relationship between electric and magnetic fields in relativity is often expressed using the electromagnetic field tensor:</p>
  <div class="equation">
    $$ F^{\mu\nu} = \partial^\mu A^\nu - \partial^\nu A^\mu $$
  </div>
  <p>
    Where \( A^\mu \) is the four-potential combining scalar and vector potentials. This tensor transforms under Lorentz transformations,
    unifying electric and magnetic fields into a single framework.
