  <h1>Angular Motion in Collisions of Bodies</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Angular motion is a critical aspect of physics, especially when studying collisions involving rotating bodies. This lesson introduces key angular motion concepts—Angular Position, Angular Displacement, Angular Velocity, and Angular Acceleration—with beginner-friendly explanations, real-world applications, and fun facts.</p>

  <h2>1. Angular Position (\( \theta \))</h2>
  <p>Angular Position represents the orientation of a line with respect to a reference axis, typically measured in radians (rad).</p>
  <p>It is analogous to linear position in translational motion.</p>
  <div class="equation">
    $$ \theta = \frac{s}{r} $$
  </div>
  <p>Where:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>\( \theta \): Angular position (radians)</li>
    <li>\( s \): Arc length</li>
    <li>\( r \): Radius of the circle</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Real-World Example</h3>
  <p>When the hands of a clock move, their position can be described in terms of angles from a reference line. The minute hand completes a full revolution, or \(2\pi\) radians, every hour.</p>

  <h2>2. Angular Displacement (\( \Delta\theta \))</h2>
  <p>Angular Displacement is the change in angular position of a rotating body over time.</p>
  <div class="equation">
    $$ \Delta\theta = \theta_{final} - \theta_{initial} $$
  </div>

  <h3>Practical Application</h3>
  <p>In sports, a gymnast performing a spin rotates their body, changing their angular position. The total angular displacement determines how many rotations they complete.</p>

  <h2>3. Angular Velocity (\( \omega \))</h2>
  <p>Angular Velocity measures how fast an object is rotating. It’s the rate of change of angular displacement with respect to time.</p>
  <div class="equation">
    $$ \omega = \frac{\Delta\theta}{\Delta t} $$
  </div>
  <p>Measured in radians per second (rad/s).</p>

  <h3>Example in Collision</h3>
  <p>Consider a figure skater spinning. When they pull in their arms, they reduce their moment of inertia and spin faster—conserving angular momentum.</p>

  <h2>4. Angular Acceleration (\( \alpha \))</h2>
  <p>Angular Acceleration is the rate at which angular velocity changes with time.</p>
  <div class="equation">
    $$ \alpha = \frac{\Delta\omega}{\Delta t} $$
  </div>
  <p>Measured in rad/s². It can be positive (speeding up) or negative (slowing down).</p>

  <h3>Real-World Application</h3>
  <p>In car crashes, the tires may rotate rapidly and then suddenly decelerate. The high angular acceleration (or deceleration) is crucial in calculating forces involved.</p>

  <h2>Applications in Collisions of Bodies</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>In rotational collisions (like a spinning disc hitting a wall), both angular velocity and angular acceleration determine how energy and momentum are conserved.</li>
    <li>Angular momentum, given by \( L = I\omega \), must be conserved in isolated systems. This principle helps in analyzing collisions where objects spin before or after impact.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Example</h3>
  <p>A rotating wheel hits a surface and starts to roll. Understanding the angular velocity and acceleration helps predict the motion post-collision.</p>

  <h2>Equations Summary</h2>
  <div class="equation">
    \( \theta = \frac{s}{r} \)
  </div>
  <div class="equation">
    \( \omega = \frac{d\theta}{dt} \)
  </div>
  <div class="equation">
    \( \alpha = \frac{d\omega}{dt} \)
  </div>
  <div class="equation">
    \( L = I\omega \)
  </div>

  <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
  <p>The Earth is not only spinning on its axis (~0.0000727 rad/s), but also experiences angular acceleration due to gravitational influences of the Moon and Sun. This affects ocean tides and even slight shifts in time measurement!</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Understanding angular motion is essential in analyzing the dynamics of rotational collisions. Whether it's in engineering crash tests, sports physics, or planetary science, angular kinematics provides a deep insight into motion where spinning or rotation is involved.</p>
