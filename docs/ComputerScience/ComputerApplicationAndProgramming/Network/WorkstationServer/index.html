  <h1>Network Topic: Workstation and Server</h1>

  <p>In any network environment, two key types of devices that play crucial roles are <strong>Workstations</strong> and <strong>Servers</strong>. Understanding their functions, differences, and how they work together helps in grasping the basics of modern computer networking.</p>

  <h2>1. What is a Workstation?</h2>
  <p>A <strong>workstation</strong> is a high-performance computer that is used by an individual, typically for technical or scientific tasks. In a network, workstations are the end-user computers that access the resources provided by servers.</p>

  <h3>Key Features of Workstations:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Designed for individual users</li>
    <li>Connected to a network to access shared resources</li>
    <li>Can be desktops, laptops, or even mobile devices</li>
    <li>Run client software to interact with servers</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Real World Example:</h3>
  <p>In a graphic design firm, designers use workstations with powerful GPUs to render images and access files from a centralized server.</p>

  <div class="fun-fact">
    <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> The term "workstation" originally referred to terminals connected to powerful minicomputers in the 1970s!
  </div>

  <h2>2. What is a Server?</h2>
  <p>A <strong>server</strong> is a computer system that provides data, resources, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network.</p>

  <h3>Key Features of Servers:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Always on and running to provide uninterrupted services</li>
    <li>Higher processing power, memory, and storage</li>
    <li>Runs specialized server operating systems</li>
    <li>Examples: File servers, Web servers, Mail servers, Database servers</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Real World Example:</h3>
  <p>A web hosting company uses servers to store websites and serve them to users all over the world.</p>

  <div class="fun-fact">
    <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Google's servers process over 8 billion searches every day—an incredible amount of traffic handled seamlessly by powerful server systems.
  </div>

  <h2>3. Interactive Comparison</h2>
  <div class="interactive">
    <p><strong>Click the button to reveal key differences between a workstation and a server.</strong></p>
    <button onclick="toggleComparison()">Show/Hide Comparison</button>
    <div id="comparison" class="hidden">
      <table border="1" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Feature</th>
            <th>Workstation</th>
            <th>Server</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Purpose</td>
            <td>User tasks (design, documents, etc.)</td>
            <td>Provides services/data to clients</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Availability</td>
            <td>Used during work hours</td>
            <td>Runs 24/7</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>OS Type</td>
            <td>Client OS (e.g., Windows 11)</td>
            <td>Server OS (e.g., Windows Server, Linux)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Performance</td>
            <td>Good for individual use</td>
            <td>Optimized for multi-user environment</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>
  </div>

  <script>
    function toggleComparison() {
      const comp = document.getElementById("comparison");
      comp.classList.toggle("hidden");
    }
  </script>

  <h2>4. How They Work Together</h2>
  <p>Workstations (clients) request resources, files, and services from servers. This client-server model is the foundation of most modern networks.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Workstation requests a file → Server provides it</li>
    <li>Workstation sends an email → Mail server handles it</li>
    <li>Workstation logs into a website → Web server serves the site</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Practical Applications</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Offices:</strong> Employees use workstations to access shared databases on a server</li>
    <li><strong>Schools:</strong> Computer labs use a central server to manage student accounts</li>
    <li><strong>Gaming:</strong> Multiplayer online games use powerful servers to host matches</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Summary</h2>
  <p>A <strong>workstation</strong> is your personal computer in the network, while a <strong>server</strong> is the powerhouse that manages and delivers data. Understanding both is key to understanding how modern digital systems operate.</p>
